TRAFFIC SIGN RECOGNITION in AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving both depend on the ability to recognize traffic signs. In order to recognize and understand traffic signs in realtime from a photo captured by cameras installed on the car, computer vision, and machine learning techniques are used. Dealing with varying lighting and weather conditions, occlusions, and differences in sign appearances due to diverse shapes, sizes, and colors are some of the major issues in traffic sign recognition.
Various techniques have been developed, including image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) have shown promising results in traffic sign recognition, achieving high accuracy rates on standard benchmark datasets.
The goal of traffic sign recognition is to provide timely and accurate information to the driver or the autonomous driving system about road conditions and traffic rules. This can help improve road safety, reduce the risk of accidents, and enhance the driving experience.
**Image recignition using CNN** involved applying filters and image enhancement techniques to the input image or video stream  to improve the quality of the image and reduce noise and distortion. **Feature Extraction** involving identifying the relevant features in the image that can help distinguish different traffic signs. These features can include shape, color, texture, and pattern. **Classification** involved using machine learning algorithms to classify the image or video stream into different traffic signs based on the extracted features. Popular classification algorithms include support vector machines(SVMs), decision trees, and neural networks.
